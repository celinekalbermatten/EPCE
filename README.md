## Introcution
Due to different physical imaging parameters, the tone-mapping functions between images and real radiance are highly diverse, which makes HDR reconstruction extremely challenging. Existing solutions can not explicitly clarify a corresponding relationship between the tone-mapping function and the generated HDR image, but this relationship is vital when guiding the reconstruction of HDR images. To address this problem, we propose a method to explicitly estimate the tone mapping function and its corresponding HDR image in one network.

## Files

- `split_data.py`
- `reduce_dataset.py`

- `test.py`

### Description

The whole implementation of the project has been done in Python.

The file `split_data.py` creates a dataset in the structure needed for the training and testing of the model. More information can be found in the part about the [dataset](#dataset).

The file `reduce_dataset.py` reduces the created dataset to a certain percentage of it. More information can be found in the part about the [dataset](#dataset).

The file `dataloader.py` defines a custom HDR class that loads LDR and HDR images. It provides methods to transform the images into tensors and organize the into a dictionary. MAYBE MENTION THE DECREASE DATA SIZE FUNCTION

The file `EPCE_model.py` implements a neural network architecture for HDR image processing and enhancement. It includes modules for curve estimation using polynomial functions, pixel-wise learning for image refinement and a Pyramid-Path Vision Transformer (PPViT) with transformer blocks, attention mechanisms and up- and downsampling layers, enabling advanced HDR image reconstruction. 

The file `train.py` is designed to train a model for HDR image reconstruction. It initializes the model, optimizes it using defined loss functions, does training and validation loops, saves intermediate results, and ultimately saves the trained model. Additionally, it plots the losses throughout the process.

The file `test.py`evaluates the trained HDR image model. It loads test data, applies the model to generate HDR images, saves the results, and computes evaluation metrics like PSNR and SSIM for the generated images compared to ground truth. The final results are printed.

The file `options.py` contains a class Options that defines and handles various settings and configurations used for training, debugging, and evaluation of the EPCE model. It uses the argparse module to define command-line arguments for different options like batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, GPU IDs, debugging flags, and testing options such as checkpoint paths and logging scores during evaluation. The parse() method parses these options and returns the parsed arguments.

The file `vgg.py` implements a VGG19 network for perceptual loss computation during training of HDR image generation models, using pre-trained layers to extract features and compute the loss.

The file `util.py` contains several utility functions including methods for checkpoint loading and saving, HDR image tonemapping, saving HDR and LDR images, updating learning rates and plotting losses. 


## Dataset

The dataset is expected to contain LDR (input) and HDR (ground truth) image pairs. The network is trained to learn the mapping from LDR images to their corresponding HDR ground truth counterparts.

The dataset should have the following folder structure: 

```
> dataset
    > train
        > HDR
            > hdr_image_1.hdr/exr
            > hdr_image_2.hdr/exr
            .
            .
        > LDR
            > ldr_image_1.jpg/png
            > ldr_image_2.jpg/png
            .
            .
    > test
        > HDR
            > hdr_image_1.hdr/exr
            > hdr_image_2.hdr/exr
            .
            .
        > LDR
            > ldr_image_1.jpg/png
            > ldr_image_2.jpg/png
            .
            .
```

### Create your own dataset

If you want to generate a dataset from your own images, order your LDR and HDR images according to the following folder structure:

```
> NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER_WITH_THE_DATA (put as data path)

    > raw_ref_video_hdr
        - contains the test HDR and LDR images in .hdr format

    > raw_video_png
        - contains the test LDR images in .png format

    > tile_ref_video_hdr
        - contains the training HDR and LDR images in .hdr format

    > tile_ref_video_png
        - contains the training HDR and LDR images in .png format
```

When your data is structured in the above ways, split your data by using the provided script: 
```sh
python3 split_data.py data_path
```

**Note:** `data_path` is the path (str) to the dataset on your local computer

### Reduce the size of the dataset

Since the EPCE model is very large and training on a lot of images takes a lot of time, the dataset can be reduced to a certain percentage of it. By doing so, the precision of the model will be less high but the training time is decreased significantly. 
In order to reduce the dataset, the file `reduce_dataset.py` can be executed. A new directory containing the reduced dataset is created and the model can then be trained on this reduced dataset.


## Training


After the dataset has been prepared, the model can be trained using:

```sh
python3 train.py
```
- Training results (LDR input, HDR prediction and HDR ground truth) are stored in the **`train_results`** directory.

## Evaluation of the model

The performance of the network can be evaluated using: 

```sh
python3 test.py --ckpt_path /path/to/checkpoint
```

- Test results (LDR input, HDR prediction and HDR ground truth) are stored in the **`test_results`** directory.
- HDR images can be visualised using [OpenHDRViewer](https://viewer.openhdr.org) or by installing [HDR + WCG Image Viewer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PGN3NWPBWL9?rtc=1&hl=fr-ch&gl=CH) on windows.
- If the checkpoint path is not specified, it defaults to `checkpoints/latest.ckpt` for evaluating the model.
- PSNR and SSIM scores can be logged for quantitative evaluation by:

```sh
python3 test.py --log_scores
```
