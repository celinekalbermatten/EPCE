## Introcution
Due to different physical imaging parameters, the tone-mapping functions between images and real radiance are highly diverse, which makes HDR reconstruction extremely challenging. Existing solutions can not explicitly clarify a corresponding relationship between the tone-mapping function and the generated HDR image, but this relationship is vital when guiding the reconstruction of HDR images. To address this problem, we propose a method to explicitly estimate the tone mapping function and its corresponding HDR image in one network.

**`requirements.txt`** is provided to install the necessary Python dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset is expected to contain LDR (input) and HDR (ground truth) image pairs. The network is trained to learn the mapping from LDR images to their corresponding HDR ground truth counterparts.

The dataset should have the following folder structure - 

```
> dataset

    > train
        > HDR

                > hdr_image_1.hdr/exr
                > hdr_image_2.hdr/exr
                .
                .

        > LDR

            > ldr_image_1.jpg/png
            > ldr_image_2.jpg/png
            .
            .


    > test
        > HDR

                > hdr_image_1.hdr/exr
                > hdr_image_2.hdr/exr
                .
                .

        > LDR

            > ldr_image_1.jpg/png
            > ldr_image_2.jpg/png
            .
            .
```

- The train and test datasets can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KyE1_YEZJeJ_O8cztDCHOH0f19J_vnnb?usp=sharing)
- The pretrained model has been trained on 1700 256x256 LDR/HDR pairs generated by tiling 34 2560x1280 test LDR/HDR frames into 50 smaller frames (check in the report for details). 



### Create your own dataset

If you want to generate a dataset from your own images, order your LDR and HDR images according to the following folder structure:

```
> NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER_WITH_THE_DATA (put as data path)

    > raw_ref_video_hdr
        - contains the test HDR and LDR images in .hdr format

    > raw_video_png
        - contains the test LDR images in .png format

    > tile_ref_video_hdr
        - contains the training HDR and LDR images in .hdr format

    > tile_ref_video_png
        - contains the training HDR and LDR images in .png format
```

When your data is structured in the above ways, split your data by using the provided script: 
```sh
python3 split_data.py data_path
```

**Note:** `data_path` is the path (str) to the dataset on your local computer


## Training


After the dataset has been prepared, the model can be trained using:

```sh
python3 ACHTUNGACHTUNG.py
```
- Training results (LDR input, HDR prediction and HDR ground truth) are stored in the **`train_results`** directory.

The corresponding parameters/options for training have been specified in the **`options.py`** file and can be easily altered. They can be logged using -

```sh
python3 ACHTUNGACHTUNG.py --help
```
- **`--iter`** param is used to specify the number of feedback iterations for global and local feedback mechanisms (refer to paper/architecture diagram)
- Checkpoints of the model are saved in the **`checkpoints`** directory. (Saved after every 2 epochs by default)
- GPU is used for training. Specify GPU IDs using **`--gpu_ids`** param.
- The model takes around 5 hours to train on a dataset of 1700 images on a Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB GPU.

### Pretrained models

Three pre-trained models can be downloaded from the following links. 

These models have been trained with the default options, on 256x256 size images for 200 epochs. (MAYBE MODIFY)

- FHDR model trained on clear sky 256x256 images with 200 epoch [UP-COMING]


## Evaluation of the model

The performance of the network can be evaluated using: 

```sh
python3 ACHTUNGTEST.py --ckpt_path /path/to/checkpoint
```

- Test results (LDR input, HDR prediction and HDR ground truth) are stored in the **`test_results`** directory.
- HDR images can be viewed using [OpenHDRViewer](https://viewer.openhdr.org) or by installing [HDR + WCG Image Viewer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PGN3NWPBWL9?rtc=1&hl=fr-ch&gl=CH) on windows.
- If the checkpoint path is not specified, it defaults to `checkpoints/latest.ckpt` for evaluating the model.
- PSNR and SSIM scores can be logged for quantitative evaluation by:

```sh
python3 ACHTUNGTEST.py --log_scores
```
